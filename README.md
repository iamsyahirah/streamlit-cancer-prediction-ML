# Breast Cancer Prediction Web App

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-Live_App-green)](https://webapp-ml-cancer-prediction.streamlit.app/)

This repository contains the source code for a web-based application that predicts breast cancer based on user input. The app is built using Streamlit and utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users adjust measurements using sliders to input relevant medical information into the web app.
2. **Model Prediction**: The app processes the input through a trained machine learning model.
3. **Prediction Display**: The app displays whether the prediction is benign or malignant, along with a scatter plot and polar chart for visual representation.


## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building and deploying the web app.
- **Python**: Core programming language used.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and prediction.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly**: For visualizing data.
