# Breast Cancer Prediction Web App

[![Streamlit App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Streamlit-Live_App-green)](https://webapp-ml-cancer-prediction.streamlit.app/)

This repository contains the source code for a web-based application that predicts breast cancer based on user input. The app is built using Streamlit and utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for users to input data and receive predictions.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Instantaneous predictions based on user inputs.
- **Machine Learning**: Utilizes a trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of breast cancer.
- **Data Visualization**: Visual representation of input data and prediction outcomes.

## How It Works

1. **Input Data**: Users enter relevant medical information into the web app.
2. **Model Prediction**: The app processes the input through a trained machine learning model.
3. **Prediction Display**: The likelihood of breast cancer is displayed, along with visual aids for better understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building and deploying the web app.
- **Python**: Core programming language used.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and prediction.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing data.

## Installation
